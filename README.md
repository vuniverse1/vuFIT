# vuFIT

This is my personal calorie tracker to keep me in shape. Made with Python, HTML, CSS, Django, Charts.js, and an API to obtain different caloric values for different foods.
html.index file is located in tracker/template folder
## Getting Started
to set up your local environment, use the following steps:

```
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate 
pip install django
python3 manage.py runserver
```

This will create a virtual environment, activate it, install Django, and start the Django development server. You can then access your Django project at 
http://localhost:8000
